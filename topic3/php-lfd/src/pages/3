The LFD leaped into action! Their leader, Sir Scribbles-a-Lot, twirled his mustache and shouted, “To the Doodle-Mobile!” as the team jumped aboard a giant sketchpad-shaped vehicle. Alongside him were:

<ul>
<li>
Captain Crayon, who could summon waxy rainbows at will,
</li>

<li>
The Shady Artist, who wielded a magical shading pencil,
</li>

<li>
Professor Puddle, a watercolor wizard,
</li>

<li>
And Glitterbomb, whose sparkly attacks could blind enemies with fabulousness.
</li>
</ul>
