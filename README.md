# COMP6[48]43 Intro Challenges

These challenges are simple demonstrations of vulnerabilities and web concepts that you can use to learn about new vulnerabilities and techniques. These will also be used in lectures and tutes as demos. This repository contains the source for all of them, you can run them yourself, modify them and otherwise experiment.

## Setup
1. Follow the relevant Docker Desktop install instructions for your platform: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
2. `cd` into the directory of the challenge you want to run.
3. Follow the instructions in the README file to run and access the challenge.

## Contributing
If you find an issue/bug in the challenges (aside from the intended vulnerability of course), you are welcome to either post an issue here or on the course forum. Pull requests will not be accepted, as this repository is automatically generated from the main COMP6[48]43 repository.
