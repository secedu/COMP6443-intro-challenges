# OAuth demo

A challenge that demonstrates the basics of OAuth.

To run locally, use `docker compose up --build` to start the application. Use CTRL-C to stop the application.
When the application is running, access http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
If you want to modify the source code, stop the app with CTRL-C, and start it again to rebuild (that's what the `--build` part of the command does).

Note: You may need to use `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose` depending on how you installed compose.
